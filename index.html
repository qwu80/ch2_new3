      <div class="col-lg-1"></div>
      <p class="col-lg-10">
        So far, we have seen that an electron may exist in various states which we called them orbitals. A key concept
        for understanding semiconductor physics is that each orbital has a distinct energy; hence, the allowed energy
        levels for an electron are quantized. Here we review the concepts of kinetic and potential energies in classical
        physics and study the quantized energy levels of electrons in a hydrogen atom.

        <h1>Hydrogen Atom</h1>
        <p>Once again, we look at a Hydrogen atom that consists of one electron and one proton.
        </p>
        <p>These subatomic particles are equally, but oppositely, charged.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>Coulomb Force</h1>
        <p>The attraction force between the electron and proton is governed by the Coulomb's law:</p>
        <p>\[F = {q^2 \over 4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}\]</p>
        <p>Here \[\epsilon_0\] is permittivity of free space, \[q\] is electron charge, and \[r\] is the distance
          between the
          particles.

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h1>The Potential Energy</h1>
        <p>The electronâ€™s potential energy at any point in space is the work done by an external force to move the
          electron from the reference point to that point at a constant velocity.</p>
        <p>To move the electron at constant velocity, we need to apply an external force that is equal but opposite to the
          Coulomb force. </p>
        <svg id="pe-viz"></svg>
        <p>When is the work done on the electron positive and when is negative? When is the potential energy positive
          and when is it negative?</p>
        <p>If we define the potential to be zero at infinity, the potential energy can be calculated as \[E_p = {-q^2
          \over4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}\]</p>

        <h1>Total Energy of Electron</h1>
        <p>The classical model assumed that the electron revolves around the proton, giving rise to a kinetic energy
          defined by \[E_k = {1 \over 2} m v ^2\]</p>
        <svg id="d3-viz"></svg>
        <p>Note that we have slowed down the electron rotation by many orders of magnitude for demonstration purposes.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>The total energy of the electron would hence be the sum of the potential and kinetic energies, as shown.</p>
        <p>We can see that these are change with changing radii of the electron.</p> -->

        <h1>Absorption of Energy</h1>
        <p>
          If a photon is shined on a hydrogen atom, the electron may absorb its energy. With the classical model, any
          photon can potentially be absorbed.

        <p>Can you find which photon energies are absorbed?</p>
        <p>Each distinct energy level corresponds to an orbital, with 1S having the lowest energy level (n=1) and 2S,
          2Px, 2Py,2Pz have the second lowest energy levels (n=2). For other atoms that have more than one electron, 2P
          orbitals have a slightly larger energy compared to 2S due to electron-electron interaction. </p>
